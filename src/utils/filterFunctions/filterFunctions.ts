   * .reduce() is a method that takes a list (array)

   * Start with an empty object. Then, for each day in the grouped data:
        Filter out any activities that don't match what the user selected.
        If anything is left for that day, add that day and those items to the final result.
        Keep going until you've checked every day.
        Return the final object.
